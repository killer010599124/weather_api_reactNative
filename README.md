# weather_api_reactNative
 This project is a demonstration of using React Native to create a mobile application that accesses the Visual Crossing Weather API (https://www.visualcrossing.com/resources/documentation/weather-api/timeline-weather-api/). This weather API allows you to access both forecast and historical weather data for use within any app or application. If you are interested in developing your own mobile weather application, please contact me.
